# PyLorex

PyLorex is a Python library designed to interface with Lorex security cameras, allowing users to access camera feeds, control camera settings, and manage recordings programmatically.

The library allows for **intrinsic camera calibration** and **homography estimation**, enabling users to correct lens distortion and map camera views to real-world coordinates: With intrinsics and a homography, every pixel can be mapped to an (X, Y) position on that plane. But if the object is not on that plane, the mapping doesnâ€™t hold anymore. Also, this only holds as long **as the camera is not moved**.

# Scripts

+ `script_collect_calibration_images`: Captures a sequence of calibration images from a configured camera and saves them to the project's calibration image folder.
+ `script_run_calibration`: Calibrates a camera from a set of chessboard images and saves the camera intrinsics and an undistorted preview image.
+ `script_assess_calibration`: Assesses the quality of a camera calibration. Generates an HTML report.
+ `script_test_lorex`: Tests getting images from a Lorex camera and undistorting them using previously saved camera intrinsics.
